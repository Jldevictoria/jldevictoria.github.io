## Background

In 2005 or so, I started playing a small free to play mmorpg called "Rubies of Eventide".  
Perhaps it was partially due to the formative years in which I discovered the game, but even now in 2017, I remember it as one of the most engaging and rewarding games that I have ever participated in. (Vanilla World of Warcraft takes first place on that list)
The character development system was very unique for a digital rpg, I like to think that it shared the feeling of freedom that many people experience playing traditional rpgs such as DnD.
The playerbase ADORED the game, and though their numbers were few, the people who played were dedicated, consistently contributing to a thriving culture unique among all others.
