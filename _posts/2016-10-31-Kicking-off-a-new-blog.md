Back in 2014 nearing the end of my college career, I decided to try my hand at blogging.

I started up a cool little blog on the ghost (node.js) platform hosted on my own little Red Hat Open Shift gear.  I spent a week customizing the layout and trying to make it aesthetically pleasing, and then posted about 5 entries over the next year or so.  

It was fun, but I started delving into too many controversial issues and got tired of the implications of talking about politics and religion.  That pretty much pushed me to stop posting blog entries.  I also really disliked the name of my previous blog (It was called "The Enginerd").  It sounded kinda tryhard and didn't really describe me the way I wanted it to.

Honestly I wanted to name this blog something like "Joseph DeVictoria's Blog" or some variation of that... but then that made the page have my name on it too many times.. 

I find that I generally learn when I make a mistake and have to go fix it.  Because of that, I decided that I will stick with the name "Documenting Mistakes" until I think of something more fitting.  I want this blog to be somewhere where I can post abou the technical challenges I have with all of the projects that I'm working on.

Hopefully using this blog regularly might motivate me to actually finish a project every now and then.
