## My Programming History

The first time I tried my hand at programming I was around 10 or 11 years old.
My best friend Ciaran and I were really into video games at that time, and we had just started transitioning from Super Nintendo and Nintendo 64 to PC games on Windows.
Both of our dads had taken programming courses in college and I was able to dig up my father's copy of *The C Programming Language*, as well as a CD with the *Borland C IDE & Compiler*.
Naturally our first programs were simple (I actually remember programming "Hello, World!" in C back in 2001 or so!) but after understanding the basic compilation method and file structure, our first project was to try to create a game.
The game we created was an adventure game.  It was very short, only lasting a few steps before terminating, but it had multiple branches, and left a natural inclination towards computer science in my head.

In 2005-2008, *Myspace* came around offering what to my experience was the first *Social Network* that ever took off.  Everyone was using it, myself included.
One of the features of Myspace was that you could alter the HTML blocks and CSS of your homepage to add in custom designs and content.
I was never really amazing at it, but it pushed me to learn HTML and CSS, and eventually, my Myspace page was pretty cool.

For some reason during High School I was never really interested in taking the AP Computer Science course offered at my school.
I think my peers had told me how boring it was, and I didn't really understand what would be taught in CS.
When I got to college however, I signed up for my first programming class called "Object Oriented Programming" which was taught using the Java Language.
That was one of my most influential classes in college, because even though it was very, very difficult, it gave me a really solid foundation for learning to program.

After that first semester I went on to take classes which heavily utilized the following languages, in order: C (Several classes), Verilog, C++, Matlab, and VHDL.
I worked three out of my four college years in a Computer Technician role at the campus library.  Working there exposed me to the Windows and Apple scripting languages: Powershell and Applescript.
I took an internship the summer of my junior-senior year where I was fortunate enough to work heavily with Linux, which compelled me to learn: Bash scripting and Python.
I think this was the point where I began to treat computer programming languages as tools with a specific purpose and application.

As I graduated and moved on to my current position at Micron Technology, I have gained a lot of utility by continuing to use and learn Python, however the testing equipment has been built around an infrastructure using primarily Perl.
Because of this necessity, I have become somewhat proficient with Perl.

During the past three years or so, I have also taken on a number of personal projects, which exposed me heavily to the world of full-stack web development (Javascript and PHP), .NET, C#, and Lua.
I also learned SQL, but I usually lump that in with things like Regular Expressions, and File Systems.  Its kinda a language, but more of a programming concept in my eyes.

## Language Enjoyment Ranking

In the end I would say I have significant exposure to the following languages (HDL Languages aren't exactly programming languages, but I'll include them).
I will list in my order of enjoyment:

1. Python.
2. Java.
3. C++.
4. C.
5. Verilog / VHDL.
6. Lua.
7. C#.
8. Javascript / HTML.
9. Perl.
10. Powershell / Bash / Applescript.
11. PHP

I also have some experience with Ruby, Racket, Rust, Go, and a few others, (just tinkering level) but I haven't really been sucked in by them yet.

## My Takeaways

As my exposure to different languages has increased, my perspective on programming in general has changed.
Each language has its own merits and focus, and it's much more important to learn specific concepts and skills within Computer Science, than to become the master of any single language.
That being said, I don't think it's a bad idea to build a home base in two languages that you really enjoy.

Most new programmers will benefit by planting their feet firmly in one staticly-typed compiled language (Such as C or Java), and one dynamically-typed interpreted langauge (Such as Python or Perl).
If you master one instance of those two categories, it really sets you up for success when you eventually need to learn another langauge.

To close it out, I think getting a formal education in Computer Science or Engineering is a huge benefit when approaching the Software and Technology industry.
I appreciate that I learned how to program in college, but I also appreciate that they taught me in detail how computers work as well.
Personally I am by no stretch a great programmer, but it is definitely fun to try new things, and see what benefits can come from languages I havent tried yet.
