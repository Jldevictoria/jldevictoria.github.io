## The College Years

I took my first Computer Science class at BYU in 2009.  
For as much as I thought I knew about computers during high school (I had built my own PC and had several hand be down computers as early as elementary school), my programming knowledge was somewhat minimal.
I had taken a "game development" class in high school from an utterly incompetent California teacher, where we played around with Visual Basic and pretended we knew how to model, but I had never been required to complete an extensive software development task.

CS 142 was a bit of a shock for me as an entering freshman in college.  I read back through the incredibly embarrasing and grammatically challenged Facebook "notes" that I published during that year, I dug up this gem from a note about programming:

> So this winter semester I took CS 142, Introduction to Computer Programming. It's basically how to program in JAVA. 
> When I signed up for the class I was thinking it would be an easy class with just very basic programming and like information about computing and stuff, and for the first 2 and 1/2 weeks it was.....just simple stuff like the parts of a computer and other junk, but not in depth at all. 
> Our first lab was the famous "Hello World!" lab where you write a program to print out that line on the screen. 
> But for those of you who have taken the class I respect you, and believe that you know the pain (as I do) of 142. 
> Starting in the second month of classes the labs for CS 142 will start taking you about 10 hours each. 
> And you may be thinking "So what 10 hours is nothing, I spent more time than that on my final paper for whatever class" 
> But these labs weren't just at the end of the class they were every two weeks, some of them taking up to 20 hours (personally) of time.

Deadlines and grades became a very real thing, generating regular all-nighters and sleep deprivation.  I'm sure my productivity was terrible, but I have vivid memories of spending the entire night in front of the computer trying to satisfy the constraints of a lab project before my class.

In hindsight, the projects that I had to complete in my first Computer Science class were fairly simple.  (Implementing simple mathematical models, making a sales system, creating a program to store and look up students in a student directory.) But at the time, they seemed very difficult, and the time commitment needed to complete them was unlike anything I had experienced before.
To be fair, the labs the following class (Data Structures and Algortihms) were arguably easier than those in CS142, but they paled in comparison to other projects that I have taken on in my life.

Our final project for CS240 (Advanced Programming Concepts) was to recreate a basic version of a piece of record indexing software developed by the LDS Church.  It involved Server-Client architecture, XML, SQL Databases, Authentication, Front end GUI design and more.  Even though they gave us the better part of 2 months to complete the project, it was considerably larger in scope than anything I had taken on it in my introductional programming class.

## Product Engineering

After college I immediately took a job working for Micron Technologies developing 3D NAND Flash components. (I currently work here at the time of this publishing)  Due to my engineering degree and experience with semiconductor electronics, I did have the required technical skills to effectively integrate into the product engineering team.

Although our team is responsible for the implementation of all of the post-silicon testing of the flash devices, my job has only included about 10-15% programming tasks.  The job is very technical and gives me a lot of exposure to important digital technology, but I definitely with I could do more programming.

Due to this desire, I have taken on a lot of different personal projects.  I have a few projects I started before my graduation in April of 2015, and several I have started since.  Some are completely for personal expression and entertainments, others are (at least hypothetically) for profit.  The problem is that I am constantly starting new projects without ever finishing any of the old ones.

This is a rough sketch of how my personal projects have been going for the last few years:

Heres a rough overview of each project and its status today:

| Name | Description | Status |
| ---- | ----------- | ------ |
| Newcookbook | A website idea that I had to create a recipe sharing Reddit clone.  It was implemented on a simple LAMP stack and the original bootstrap. | After about 3 months of working on it, I had a registration system, a dynamic front page, and simple post creation finished, but I lost steam and got busy with School.  Also it already had so much competition, I'm pretty sure it would have failed.  I mainly wanted to dip my hand into web development.  Honestly it was a great experience even though it flopped. |
| Oldentide | A MORPG game meant to emulate the wonderful features of Rubies of Eventide. | I am actually still working on this project, and would love to finish it some day.  I have a working dedicated server, and basic communication to a Unity based game.  It needs a ton of work, but I have a strong backend set up already.  I plan to continnue this and maybe actually change the engine to 2D just to make this game something playable instead of just a bunch of semi-runnable code.  I will probably do more posts about this in the future as I have a special passion for this game. |
| Mutable | I am playing this one kinda close to the chest, but it is a web project with a supplementary income goal in mind. | I am actively working on this project, and will be blogging about my struggles for sure. |
| Unexpose | A real-time pornography screening addon for Chrome. It uses page analysis to warn the user when pornography exposure is likely. | I basically abandoned this due to lack of a good algorithm for implementing this.  I still think it is a good idea, and my working code does what I want it to, but it needs an experienced eye to be good. |
| Angry Engineers | An Arduino based engineering competition at BYU where we had to create a sonar based turret and compete for functionality. | We (Our team of 4 people) actually finished this project, but it didnt work very well.  I consider it a success, but don't really have any plans of adding to it. |
| The Enginerd | My first stab at making an internet presence.  It included a blog and a YouTube Channel. | It was kinda a terrible idea...  The name makes me a little sick now, because it sounds too tryhard.  I recently deleted the blog.  The YouTube Channel is still around, but I am planning on changing the name eventually. |
| K&R C-Bible | An effort to refresh my C skills by reading through Kernighan and Ritchie's The C Programming Language and completing all of the exercises. | I am still planning on completing this project, but so far I have only gotten through chapter one, because of all of my other projects. |
| This Blog | I plan on this blog being much truer to my actual life.  I want to document my projects and troubleshooting as I try to complete them. | This is just starting now, and I'm tentatively using the name "Documenting Mistakes".  I plan to post regularly, but we will see how it goes! |

As you can see, I keep putting in more projects without finishing the ones in the pipe.  Actually my inspiration for writing this post comes from a segment I recently heard on the Stack Overflow Podcast where [Tom Lehman describes](https://soundcloud.com/stack-exchange/stack-overflow-podcast-93-a-very-spolsky-halloween-special) how he had to "take one turkey out of the oven before he could bake the next one" referring to his transition into creating [genius.com](https://genius.com).

I really like that philosophy.  I feel strongly that if I ever want to complete a personal project, I need to stop starting new ones.  It would also probably help for me to either chill or abandon some of the ones I have right now.

## Moving Forward

As 2017 approaches, I think its a really good idea to look at what you are working on and prioritize one to finish in the coming year.

For me this project is Mutable.  I will continue to update this blog, but I'm planning on keeping this project as my main programming goal.

I will give more updates on it when I feel confident to share my ideas!
